## Requirements
* Magento Community 2.2.0-2.4.x (CE, EE, ECE, B2B)
* The latest available version for Magento 2.1.x is Extra Fee v1.0.5 


## Main Features

* Custom fee tag

* Automatically apply to order total

* Multistore support

* Cart and checkout page display

* Set minimum order amount


## Features

* **Custom Fee Tag**

The admin can readily enable the extension and add a custom name for the fee also. The name can vary from gift wrap to rush order to packaging charges. 

* **Automatically Apply to Order Total**

Once the store owner sets the price from the Magento backend, extra charges will automatically be applied to the storefront. Along with the order total, it will be set on its own. 

* **Multistore Support**

The extension is supported in multiple stores. This means that you can apply the extension features to all of your stores if you are running multiple stores. 

* **Cart and Checkout Page Display**

The total extra fee will be displayed on the cart page and checkout page with the total order that is calculated.

* **Set Minimum Order Amount**

The admin can also set the minimum order amount from the store backend. If the order amount matches the minimum set amount only then the extra fee will be displayed on the front end.

## Benefits

* **Encourages transparency in the product total**

The order total will be clearly defined on the checkout and cart page. It will clearly bifurcate the product charges and the extra fee included in the total amount payable. This promotes transparency in the order total in front of the customers. 

* **Increase average order value**

The extension helps enhance the order total amount. Hence, it results in higher-order value which eventually leads to increased revenue for your Magento store.

* **Multistore support**

If you have multiple stores, you can swiftly apply the extra charges to all your stores.
